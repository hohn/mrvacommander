## The notes/ directory
   The `notes/` directory serves as staging directory for documentation.  This is
   the place to develop documentation and short notes.  The contents of this
   directory should be accessible to 
   1.  The note authors and
   2.  Developers of the project
   
   It need not be meaningful to casual users.
