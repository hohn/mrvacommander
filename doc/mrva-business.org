* MRVA for CodeQL: A Business View
** Introduction
   The companion documents in this directory are mostly technical. The purpose of
   this document is to explain, from a business perspective, what MRVA is and why
   it matters.

   To illustrate its impact, consider two real-world cases:

*** Case 1: Preventing Costly Security Failures
    One of our customers faced a significant lawsuit due to inadequate security. 
    The root cause? Unaddressed technical risks in their code. The work we do 
    directly prevents similar vulnerabilities from reaching this stage.

    While lawsuits of this scale are rare, security failures are not. More common 
    consequences include:

    - Compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, SOC2 penalties)
    - Security breaches leading to reputation damage
    - Productivity loss from disruptive technical failures

    Lawsuits may be exceptional, but code security failures occur daily. Our role 
    isn’t just about preventing catastrophic losses—it’s about avoiding the small, 
    accumulating failures that erode security, compliance, and trust over time.

*** Case 2: Identifying Hidden Risks at Scale
    Another customer manages a massive software portfolio of 120,000+ distinct 
    codebases—a scale at which traditional security tools and manual review 
    processes become impractical. 

    - A few known vulnerabilities had already been identified and patched.
    - Our analysis uncovered 30 additional high-risk instances, previously undetected.

    These findings were critical because:

    - Traditional security tools break down at scale. Most solutions work well for 
      isolated codebases but lack the capability to analyze patterns across 
      120,000 repositories.
    - Complexity hides risk. Identifying these vulnerabilities required specialized 
      techniques beyond simple scanning—capable of handling variations, 
      context, and subtle exploit paths.
    - Existing security processes failed to detect these vulnerabilities. Without 
      proactive intervention, these risks would have remained undetected until 
      a potential breach occurred.

    This case highlights a critical gap in standard security practices. By leveraging 
    advanced, scalable analysis, we identified and mitigated risks that would have 
    otherwise gone unnoticed—demonstrating the value of proactive security 
    at scale.

** Why This Matters
   These examples, along with others, reinforce the importance of proactive 
   security—especially in the context of MRVA. Security risks don’t just exist 
   in theory; they have tangible business consequences. 

   MRVA provides a scalable, systematic approach to identifying and addressing 
   risks before they escalate—ensuring that security is a strategic advantage, not 
   just a cost.
   
** What is MRVA?
   MRVA stands for /Multi-Repository Variant Analysis/. The concept is straightforward:

   1. A /problem/ is identified in one codebase.
   2. Variations of this problem (/variants/) can be defined.
   3. The organization manages many code repositories (/multi-repository/).
   4. A systematic /analysis/ is required to detect these variants across all repositories.

   In practice:
   - Steps 1 & 2: Defined through CodeQL queries, often custom-written for this purpose.
   - Steps 3 & 4: Can be done manually but come with significant challenges.

*** Challenges of Manual Execution
    Manually searching for these variants across multiple repositories is possible
    but inefficient and error-prone due to:

    - /High bookkeeping overhead/ – Tracking thousands of repositories is
      cumbersome.
    - /Heavy scripting requirements/ – Expert /Unix scripting skills/ are
      necessary.
    - /Scaling limitations/ – Analyzing /thousands of repositories sequentially/
      is slow, and manual parallelization is impractical.
    - /Cumbersome review process/ – Results are stored as /raw text files/,
      requiring multiple processing steps for meaningful analysis.

*** MRVA: A Streamlined, Integrated Solution
    Instead of relying on manual effort, MRVA is designed to /automate and
    integrate/ the process.

    - The system is designed to be /machine-driven/ and integrated into an
      automated pipeline.
    - Once incorporated, MRVA leverages the /CodeQL VS Code plugin/ to provide a
      /seamless user experience/.
    - How it works:
      - Users submit queries through the UI.
      - Results are retrieved and displayed dynamically as they become available.
      - The entire workflow is automated, scalable, and significantly more
        efficient than manual methods.

    By eliminating manual inefficiencies, MRVA enables organizations to identify
    and resolve security issues across massive codebases at scale, ensuring both
    accuracy and speed in vulnerability detection.
